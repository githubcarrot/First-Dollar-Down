      <h2>How I Budgeted My First Part-Time Job Paycheck</h2>
      <p><em>Published: July 2025</em></p>

      <p>Getting my first paycheck was exciting. But once the money hit my account, I realized I had no idea what to actually do with it.</p>

      <p>I started by breaking it into three categories: spending, saving, and giving. I kept 60% for things I needed or wanted, saved 30%, and donated 10% to a local cause I care about. This simple rule helped me stay disciplined without overthinking everything.</p>

      <p>I used a free app to track expenses and made sure I was putting some money aside every month. Now I try to adjust that split depending on my goalsâ€”but having a plan from the beginning made a huge difference.</p>

      <p>If you're getting paid for the first time, don't just let it sit there. Make a plan, even if it's super simple. Your future self will thank you.</p>
