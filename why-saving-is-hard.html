      <h2>Why Saving is Hard in High School (and How I'm Trying Anyway)</h2>
      <p><em>Published: July 2025</em></p>

      <p>Between food runs, concert tickets, and random Amazon buys, saving money as a high schooler feels impossible. I get it—every dollar is tempting to spend.</p>

      <p>But once I realized my money was just slipping away with nothing to show for it, I tried a new rule: every time I got paid or received money, I saved 20% before spending anything. No exceptions.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I fail. Sometimes I save more. But just having a system changed how I think. Now when I see something I want, I ask: “Is this worth my future goal being further away?”</p>

      <p>Saving isn’t about perfection—it’s about direction. Start small, be consistent, and don’t beat yourself up for the slip-ups.</p>
