      <h2>Robinhood Review: My First Investing App Experience</h2>
      <p><em>Published: July 2025</em></p>

      <p>Robinhood was the first investing app I tried, mostly because everyone online made it seem super easy—and it is. The design is sleek, the setup took 5 minutes, and I was able to start with just a few dollars.</p>

      <p>What I liked: the interface is clean, and fractional shares meant I didn’t need hundreds to invest in big-name companies. I also appreciated the real-time price movement, even if it made me check too often.</p>

      <p>What I didn’t like: it's easy to get carried away. The app makes trading feel like a game, and it’s tempting to chase hype stocks. I learned that lesson fast (yes, I bought a meme stock… once).</p>

      <p>Final verdict: great for getting started, but don’t confuse ease of use with smart investing. Learn first, then buy.</p>
