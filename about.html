      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><strong>First Dollar Down</strong> is a student-run blog focused on teen personal finance. It was created by a high schooler who’s passionate about finance, investing, and helping other students make smart decisions with money.</p>

      <p>Everything on this site is written for students, by a student—no fancy credentials, just real experiences, experiments, and reflections on how money works in our lives.</p>

      <p>From budgeting part-time income to learning how to invest, the goal is simple: help teens take their first financial steps with confidence.</p>

      <p>If you’re reading this, you’re already ahead. Let’s grow together—one dollar at a time.</p>
